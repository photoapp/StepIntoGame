Welcom to the Axis Game Factory Scene Loader! This tool will import scenes created with AGF into your Unity project.

To "axis" the interface, navigate to Window > AGF Scene Loader.

NOTE: This package is NOT intended to be loaded into the same project as the Asset Packager. Ensure that the Asset Packager package is not imported.
