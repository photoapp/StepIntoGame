NEW FEATURES!!!!
The ability to load OBJ files is a new feature. Please do not combine 'Custom' (OBJ) objects with objects from 
an AGF asset pack in the same saved prefab. Loading of scenes with combinations of object types in prefabs is 
not supported at this time. This restriction will not be permanent as we are working on fixing it ASAP.

The user loaded textures for the terrain work.

The user loaded textures for the vegetation work.

The AGF Tri-Planar Terrain shader will only work with the DirectX3D 11 turned OFF.. Sorry.. Thats just the way it is..

The Locked Asset pack issue has been fixed. AGF should skip locked asset packs automatically.

All other AGF scene data should be loading correctly.

The new AGF Underwater fog and Underwater Lighting settings are not implemented yet. 
We will get to the underwwated fog as soon as we get some sleep and after Alex and his lovly fiance' is back from GEEK KON. 
Yes he actually goes to that show with his soon to be bride she is a rock star!!!!

If you experience any issues otherwise, please post the issue on the AGF testing forum. 
If you have any issue with this on Mac please mail mny son Gage at gage @heavyh20.com because he said he tested all of it..
